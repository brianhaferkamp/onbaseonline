Click on the Roll button.

Check the dice (diamond die is the d9) and compare the roll result to the outcomes charts (pitcher chart first).

Tap each base to toggle a baserunner. Tap the Outs label to change the outs. On the third out the name of the team at bat will change and the baserunners will be removed. After the home team makes the third out the inning number will change automatically.
